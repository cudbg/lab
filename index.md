Our overarching mission is to work on ðŸ”¥ðŸ’£  projects, with a leaning towards addressing three bottlenecks in the future of data analysis: data cleaning, creating interactive data exploration and visualization interfaces, and understanding analysis results. [These slides describe our lab's vision and a few recent projects](https://www.dropbox.com/s/yauhvxdkv0kna7h/2017-10-midwest-6pp.pdf?dl=0).

Several of our systems are [named after Mortal Kombat ninjas](http://eugenewu.net/ninjas.html)

**Data Cleaning**
Data analysis and machine learning are increasingly reliant on the quality of the input data---spurious errors and systematic corruptions can result in misleading and incorrect results.  We work on [automated data cleaning algorithms](./cleaning) that are tailored towards data science applications, as well as [crowdsourcing systems](./crowdsourcing) for collecting high-quality new data.

**Explanation & Interpretation**
Data analysis is never one-shot -- it is an iterative process where analysis results spur new analyses or ways to debug the analysis.  We work on [data explanation systems](./dbexplain) that enable analysts to highlight abnomalies in analysis results and explain potential reasons to investigate, as well as [machine learning explanation techniques](./mlexplain) that explain how and what machine learning models (e.g., deep neural networks) learn to make their predictions.

**Interactive Data Analysis System**
The current interface for data analysis is predominantly code.   We are studying techniques to improve how to design, architect, and build scalable interactive visual analysis applications.   The [Data Visualization Management System](./dvms) makes it significantly easier to build and scale interactive data visualization systems.  [Precision Interfaces](./precisioninterface) extends this technology to automatically generate new visual exploration interfaces tailored to a long tail of data analysis tasks.
