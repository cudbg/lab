<div class="callout">
High-quality data acquisition w/ humans
</div>



Web services such as Yelp, Quora, Amazon, and others rely on collecting and presenting high-quality human generated content -- reviews, questions, answers, opinions -- in order to present and share with their community of users.  Similarly, machine learning applications such as fake news detection, structured data extraction, self driving cars, rely on high-quality training data that is labeled by humans.  The key challenge in these applications is to _quickly_ collect _high-quality_ data from humans.

We have developed human-powered database and workflow systems that answer complex, open-world SQL queries using a combination of database operators as well as crowdsourced tasks.  These systems, such as [Qurk]() and [Wisteria]() focus on SQL query processing, and data cleaning pipelines, respectively.   

We also develop techniques such as [CLAMShell]() that reduce large scale data acquisition latencies _from minutes or hours to seconds_, as well as techniques to [directly improve the quality of the collected data]() by providing targeted, context-specific feedback in the data collection interface.
