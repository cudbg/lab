New York Database Day is a workshop targeting the database researchers and research-oriented practitioners in the New York area. New York has an incredibly strong database presence, and it is prime time for folks to get together. The [Database Group at Columbia University](https://cudbg.github.io) will host the inaugural NYDBDay on November 10th at Columbia University. The purpose is for researchers in the area to learn about each othersâ€™ research, have discussions on important database directions, and look for ways to grow and foster the research+industrial community.
